I get it that some may think vim is the Best for Software Engineers but I don't really think so. 
some would say if you still use vscode and not use vim you are not good enough or what ever stigma or they try to pose I think is is all bluff 

Now generally in the command line you use ctrl+insert to copy text and shift + insert to paste but vimðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ Oohh my God! 

lemme give a scenerio: you are typing and you want to quickly compy a text you'll first click on escape then 'v' to move to a so called visual mode then use 'h', 'j','k' or 'l' to move or navigate your cursor around and select texts then you use y to copy(yank) the selected text the "P", remember capital "P"! you are on your own
